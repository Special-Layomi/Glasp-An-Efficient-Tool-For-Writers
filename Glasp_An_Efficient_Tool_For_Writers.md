# Glasp: An Efficient Tool For Writers

# Introduction

To fully understand a topic and write about it, you must do a lot of research. This often involves surfing the internet and combining ideas from different sources such as blog posts, videos etc.
Traditionally, you may need to store key points and ideas from these sources in a central place like a notebook or Word document.

While this is a good practice, it has several limitations. Switching back and forth between your notes, sources, and what you’re writing can be quite tedious. You might also have difficulties saving screenshots, organizing your ideas properly, or even sharing these ideas with your teammates.
To make the process easier, Glasp provides a platform where your keynotes can be highlighted, commented on and shared, and kept in collection for future purposes.

This article will teach you how to set up Glasp on your Chrome browser. You will also learn to highlight ideas, share, and collaborate with Glasp.
